## ImageQueue_InspectorP
Logging of processing time, cycle time, image queue length and number of free images.
### How to Run
A connected InpspectorP device is necessary to run this sample.
Also a trigger signal on Digital input 1 is required, that can be controlled with
varying frequency to show the different behaviors.
Starting this sample is possible either by running the app (F5) or debugging (F7+F10).
Set a breakpoint on the first row inside the main or processImage function to debug step-by-step.
See the acquired images in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
